# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.
## Note to my reviewer

Add end date and display length of trip.
Example:
Type trip to "Boston",departing at "03/01/2020" and end date at "03/10/2020". It will give the result as "My trip to: Boston, United States
Departing: 2020-03-01, Boston is 16 days away. Trip ends: 2020-03-10 and trip length is 9"
